Using Pivotal Tracker and need to generate Release Notes? Try this script for a charm..

The concept behind this Python script is to read Pivotal Tracker stories for completion and extrapolate Releases. Share
these release notes with the client.

Original python script generously shared by Houssam (Sam) Kawtharani at PT's GetSatisfaction forum:

under a "Release Notes Generation" thread.
